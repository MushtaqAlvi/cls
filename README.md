# cls
this is s simple programme to use Windows OS console "cls" command to clear console .
as Linux have "clear" but when programmers and students works on development console based programmes or UNI assignments they face this problem
(coz I faced) to make programme genaric for Windows as well as Linux .
"cls.cpp" file is the source code written in C++ language , "cls.o" file is the object code and "cls" file is a executeable file for linux OSs compiled on ParrotOS using "Genay IDE"
just paste "cls" file to /user/bin dir and enjoy direct command "cls" in console , for overall usage
paste it to /bin 
or system bin folder then it works as a system command not only user package
AND
"clear_win.cpp" file is the source code written in C++ language for Windows to add clear command in  console , "clear.exe" file is a executeable file for windows.
paste clear.exe file into
C:\Windows\System32
to enjoy clear command of linux in windows.
# windows clear
# linux cls
# c++
# console clear
